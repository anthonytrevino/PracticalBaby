  5.0 out of 5 stars Saved my daughter!

  I bought this in target when it was on sale and I couldn't ask for a better and safer car seat! My daughter is 16 months old and still rear facing, she's so comfortable with the extended leg room! We were in an accident where my now totaled car spinned from the road into a neighborhood sign and she was laughing and playing in the back seat like nothing happened! Just added to cart and will be buying it again for my new car!

  We ended up buying a second car seat base as we have 2 cars and we bought the Graco Modes stroller which comes with a Snugride Click Connect 35 car seat. The base is indeed completely black as the seller shows, ours that came with the stroller has a little grey bottom which does not bother me at all as I have a grey car and my husband has a black car so the black one is his and the one with the grey bottom is mine hehe. I tested the base by immediately clicking the car seat into the base. It fits perfectly, no wiggle at all. Good product!
